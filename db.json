      "description": "I Finished today the UX design course 1 of 7 for Google UX Design Professional Certificate, and the experience was. Let’s talk about opening a door. Yes you got it right that User Experience Design plays even an important role with the basic operation of doors as well. Some push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. A door is a very simple device so how can doors be so confusing to some people? Suppose you are walking to a very urgent meeting and the door in front of you is confusing whether to push or pull, or if the door slides then in which direction or slides up into the roof? It might sound simple but imagine a person who is walking into a huge building with series of doors in front of him where he is not aware of which one to pull or push or slide. All artificial things are designed by humans. But even though people have designed things from prehistoric times, the field of design is relatively new, divided into many areas of specialty. The number of areas of design is enormous ranging from cloths to complex design including bridges and airports. Whatever may be the product or service it must be delightful."
